            <h3>Day 1 &amp; 2: Tokyo</h3>
            <p>
              Since Tokyo has the largest international airport in Japan, you
              will probably start your trip in Tokyo, and if you are traveling
              for 7 days, you should immediately activate your JR Pass to take
              advantage of the free JR trains that run through the city. While
              you could spend a week in Tokyo and never get bored, here are a
              few things to see and do.
            </p>
            <h3>Visit the fish market</h3>
            <p>
              Toyosu is the largest fish market in the world. This daily auction
              determines much of the world's sushi supply. You can visit the
              market for free, but a food and beverage tour of the Tsukiji
              Outside Market sells for about 13,500 yen.
            </p>
            <h3>See Sensoji Temple</h3>
            <p>
              Senso-ji Temple is beautifully painted and stands in a scenic
              location near the five-story pagoda and the famous Kaminarimon
              gate. Inside the main hall is a huge statue of the Kannon (Goddess
              of Mercy). It is always crowded, but it is worth seeing for
              yourself.
            </p>
            <h3>Drink in Golden Gai</h3>
            <p>
              This alley lined with back alley drinking establishments is lively
              at night and has a bit of a red-light district feel to it. It is
              not to be missed. Even if you don't drink, be sure to stop by and
              have a wander.
            </p>
            <h3>Visit the Imperial Palace</h3>
            <p>
              Built in the 15th century, this was the residence of the Japanese
              emperor, and although you cannot enter, the palace and its grounds
              are a peaceful place for a stroll.
            </p>
            <h3>Watch a sumo match</h3>
            <p>
              If you are in town at the right time, this is a must-see. Tickets
              sell out quickly, so book early; expect to pay around ¥3,800.

            <h3>Days 3 &amp; 4: Kyoto</h3>
            <p>
              Kyoto is without a doubt the most beautiful city in Japan. It is
              like stepping back in time. It is surrounded by mountains and
              dotted with temples, gardens, and bamboo groves. However, because
              of its beauty, it attracts many visitors, so it is best to visit
              outside of the busy summer season. But even with all the tourists,
              the city is majestic and full of many attractions. Some things to
              see and do that you shouldn’t miss are the following:
            </p>
            <h3>Visit the Golden Pavillion</h3>
            <p>
              This famous (and picturesque) temple was built in the 1950s when a
              monk burned down the previous temple (14th century) in an attempt
              to commit suicide. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of
              the most visited tourist destinations in the country.
            </p>
            <h3>Explore Gion</h3>
            <p>
              Gion is a historic geisha district. Walking along the main street,
              you can see ochaya (tea houses where geisha entertain guests),
              small stores, and many restaurants. 1,600 yen will get you a
              walking tour of Gion.
            </p>
            <h3>Wander in the Bamboo Forest</h3>
            <p>
              For a more relaxing experience, head to Arashiyama and be
              enveloped by the gentle swaying of the forest. Located near the
              famous Tenryuji Temple, it is one of the most beautiful places in
              the country (arrive early if you want to avoid the crowds).
            </p>
            <h3>Admire Ryoan-ji temple</h3>
            <p>
              This is my favorite temple in Kyoto. It is a UNESCO World Heritage
              Site and is home to a mausoleum containing the remains of seven
              emperors. The traditional rock and sand garden is considered one
              of the best in the country.

            <h3>Day 5 &amp; 7: Osaka</h3>
            <p>
              Osaka is the third largest city in Japan. Although it is a
              financial center, I come here to enjoy the food. Sushi, sashimi,
              Kobe beef, yakiniku, ramen, and many other foods are available in
              Osaka. And then there are the specialties: okonomiyaki,
              kushikatsu, etc. You can take a food tour for about 12,000 yen or
              just wander around and eat. That's all I do: eat, eat, eat. But
              don't miss Osaka Castle. Osaka Castle was built in 1931 and is not
              original, but it is still an impressive sight. There is a small
              but insightful museum, and the observatory offers a picturesque
              view of the city. The main street of Dotonbori is lined with
              restaurants and stores, with lots of neon lights and signs (ideal
              at night).
